# odin-ticTacToe
playyer 1 wil always be x and go first.
checking for win we will loop through the whole array checking indexs that are stored in the winning array.

there is a more efficient way using variables to count the lines and total plays. Game would end when total == 9, 
or one of the winning line variables == 3 or -3. however this way of doing the problem adds more lines of code 
which make the code harder to read.
